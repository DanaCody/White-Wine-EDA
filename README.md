# White-Wine-EDA
This is a project completed during Udacity's data analyst nanodegree. It is my first time flying solo doing some EDA on a data set
composed of some white wine samples. 

Unfortunately, you cannot see the plots that were generated in the rmd file. The HTML file will be posted to my blog shortly.
