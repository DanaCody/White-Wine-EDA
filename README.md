# White-Wine-EDA
This is a project completed during Udacity's data analyst nanodegree. It is my first time flying solo doing some EDA on a data set

Unfortunately, you cannot see the plots that were generated in the rmd file. The HTML file is too big to be uploaded, but I posted most of the contents to my blog:
